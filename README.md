# Game-Dango_On_The_Run

(Disclaimer)
First game I created when I was starting to learn python, needs a lot of refactoring and contains many code smells ðŸ˜† Enjoy laughing and getting lost in there!
Game was made without any engine, no Unity or Unreal engines just pure python from scratch, no fancy animations just png images moving and coding the physics from scratch too!
I have learned a lot from getting the sprites in the correct format early and size, to the importance of a UI not a console UI, the distribution, how to easily have this game in any computer, many of these questions have not been addressed here but the project allowed me to stumble upon them and think about it. 

## Overview
Simple 2D game using pygame library where you control a character that has to dodge by, jumping and moving, around the enemies which respawn quicker and with more life. You are also able to throw shurikens to enemies to decrease their life and kill them.

## Discontinued
I have started making games in Unity but one day I wish to come back to this and either recreate it on unity or re-write it all in proper python ðŸ”¥
